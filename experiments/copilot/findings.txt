Instrumentation:
- The InK bot needed some help with activating the thread at boot time.
  So the prompt has to explicitly state that it needs to make sure the thread can be selected by the scheduler.
  The CITID bot did not have this problem.
- The InK bot has no trouble detecting uses of variables and then using __GET and __SET.
- The InK bot does have trouble placing the TASK and ENTRY_TASK macros correctly.
  It often forgot to do it on either the declarations or the definitions, even though it was explicitly stated in the
  instructional prompt that both should be instrumented.
  This was likely because an example given in the instructional prompt only included declarations.
  After the example was removed and more elaboration was given, it would add all TASK and ENTRY_TASK macro's to
  the definitions and declarations, but it would not replace the entire function signature (even though this was twice explicitly stated in the instructional prompt).
  After commanding the bot "Correct the use of TASK and ENTRY_TASK" (giving no further hints), it successfully corrected itself.
  Probing for the mistake was more difficult. Only after one false positive and giving the hint that the mistake was in the InK API, did the bot successfully correct itself.
  After tweaking the instructional prompt and code instrumentation prompt some more, the bot consistently got the tasks right.
  The prompts before the tweaking are suffixed with _original.txt.
- CITID required a small prompt change: the CITID_THREAD_ENTRY_TASK should have no arguments, this was not specified earlier.
  The bot would occasionally insert the priority as the argument, which is incorrect.
