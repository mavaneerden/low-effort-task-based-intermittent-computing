INSTRUMENTATION
0_TRIVIAL
4/5 cases were 100% correct
1/5 cases were incorrect
mistake:
void __app_init() {
    __CREATE(1, t_init);
                        <-- Forgot to add __SIGNAL call
}

2_DATA_TYPE
0/5 cases were 100% correct
3/5 cases were incorrect
mistake:
void __app_init() {
    __CREATE(1, t_init);
                        <-- Forgot to add __SIGNAL call
}
5/5 cases had an incremental failure
mistake:
__shared(uint8_t blink_counter;) <-- size must be > 1 byte

3_EXTRA_VAR
0/5 cases were 100% correct
5/5 cases were incorrect
mistake:
void __app_init() {
    __CREATE(1, t_init);
                        <-- Forgot to add __SIGNAL call
}
3/5 cases had an incremental failure
mistake:
void increment_other_variable() {
    __SET(other_variable, __GET(other_variable) + 1); <-- illegal use of macro's in non-task function
}

4_INIT
0/5 cases were 100% correct
5/5 cases were incorrect
mistake (1/5):
void __app_init() {
    __CREATE(1, t_init);
                        <-- Forgot to add __SIGNAL call
}
mistake (4/5):
void increment_other_variable() {
    __SET(other_variable, __GET(other_variable) + 1); <-- illegal use of macro's in non-task function
}
5/5 cases had an incremental failure
mistake:
uint8_t blink_counter; <--- Not initialized on first boot




SELF-CORRECTION
0_TRIVIAL
1/3 cases incorrect
In the incorrect case, the AI incorrectly identified the mistake 3 times without a hint.
After hinting that it is in the InK API calls, it incorrectly identified the mistake again.
Only after the mistake was told to it, was it able to correct.

2_DATA_TYPE
3/3 cases incorrect
In all incorrect cases, was able to correct without any hints in 1 try.

3_EXTRA_VAR
1/3 cases incorrect
In all incorrect cases, was able to correct without any hints in 1 try.

4_INIT
3/3 cases incorrect
In 1/3 cases, took 3 tries to identify the mistake without hints, but incorrectly corrected it.
Was able to correct correctly after being told why its correction was incorrect.
In 2/3 cases, took 2 tries to identify the mistake without hints, and then correct.



CREATION
The following mistakes were made:
5/5 cases: forgot to add task forward declarations
0/5 cases: illegially accessed event outside entry task
1/5 cases: added TASK() macro to return task pointers
0/5 cases: did not add task-shared variable for event data
5/5 cases: did not add initialization code in __app_reboot() (although it was not specifically directed to)

correctness:
0/5 programs were 100% correct
4/5 programs had 1 mistake
1/5 programs had 2 mistakes
