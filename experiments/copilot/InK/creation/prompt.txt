Create a small CITID application for MSP430 that reacts to an interrupt from an ADC.
The application should consist of three tasks.
The first task reads the ADC data from the event that is passed to the thread.
The second task performs some computation on the ADC value using a helper function called `sensor_compute`.
The third task transmits the computed data using the helper function `sensor_transmit`.
After executing the third task, the thread waits for an interrupt again.
Assume the helper functions can be found in the header file 'sensor.h'.
Only show the code and say nothing else.
