<instrument 0_trivial>

There is a mistake in the code you wrote. Find and correct it.

COPILOT:
__shared(uint32_t blink_counter;) ==> __shared(uint32_t blink_counter)

You incorrectly identified the mistake. Try again.

COPILOT:
__CREATE(1, t_init) ==> __CREATE(1, &t_init)

You incorrectly identified the mistake. Try again.

COPILOT:
Add __SET(blink_counter, 0) to __app_init()

You incorrectly identified the mistake again. The mistake is in the InK API calls, not the plain C code. Try again.

COPILOT:
Change all task functions from
TASK(name) { }
to
TASK(name)
{ }

You incorrectly identified the mistake again. The mistake is that in your code, the thread does not run after flashing the code. Correct this.

Great.

Great. <instrument 4_init>

There is a mistake in the code you wrote. Find and correct it.

That is not the mistake. Try to find the real mistake, and make sure to preserve the original program behaviour.
