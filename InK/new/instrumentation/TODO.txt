HOW TO PROCEED

✔ Add labels to task functions
    ✔ Add include arguments to run.
    ✔ Run function instrumentation pass.

✗ Instrument global variables
    ✔ Add memory section to global variable definition
    ✔ Add pointer to global to the top of the function where the global is used.
    ✔ Replace all global references in that function with references to the pointer.
    ✗ Add include path ink/address_translation.h (for later)

✗ Instrument structs, arrays, etc.

✔ Instrument variables shared between threads
    ✔ Check if variables are used in multiple functions
    ✔ Only add memory section to globals AFTER all other processing

✗ Add instrumentation to the build script (cmake)
