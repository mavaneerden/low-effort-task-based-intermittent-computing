V1 of the instrumentation was too slow.
It required too many function calls, both for getting/setting variables
and for initializing the variables at the start of the function.

V2 of the instrumentation was a big improvement.
It was on par with the original, but slower than the corrected original.
This is because it takes 2/3 instructions to get a variable from the buffer,
compared to just 1 in case of the original.
